# Spam Detection Classifier with RoBERTa

This repository contains a **Spam Detection Classifier** built using the **RoBERTa** model, a robustly optimized version of BERT. The project is designed to identify spam messages in text data with high accuracy, leveraging the power of transfer learning and pre-trained transformer models.

## Features
- **Model**: Fine-tuned RoBERTa for spam classification.
- **Dataset**: Processed text data containing labeled spam and non-spam messages.
- **Libraries**: Hugging Face Transformers and PyTorch.
- **Pipeline**:
  - Preprocessing and tokenization of text data.
  - Fine-tuning RoBERTa for binary classification (spam vs. non-spam).
  - Evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
