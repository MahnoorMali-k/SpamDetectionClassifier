# Spam Detection Classifier with RoBERTa

This repository contains a **Spam Detection Classifier** built using the **RoBERTa** model, a robustly optimized version of BERT. The project is designed to identify spam messages in text data with high accuracy, leveraging the power of transfer learning and pre-trained transformer models.

## Features
- **Model**: Fine-tuned RoBERTa for spam classification.
- **Dataset**: Processed text data containing labeled spam and non-spam messages.
- **Libraries**: Hugging Face Transformers and PyTorch.
- **Pipeline**:
  - Preprocessing and tokenization of text data.
  - Fine-tuning RoBERTa for binary classification (spam vs. non-spam).

## How It Works

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Load and preprocess the dataset for spam detection.
   - Ensure the dataset is formatted correctly for RoBERTa input.

2. **Model Fine-Tuning**:
   - Fine-tune the pre-trained RoBERTa model on the spam dataset.
   - Use PyTorch and Hugging Face Trainer API for efficient training.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the fine-tuned model using the test set

## Quick Start

To get started with spam detection:

1. Open the provided Colab notebook.
2. Upload the dataset to the notebook.
3. Run all cells in the notebook to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
